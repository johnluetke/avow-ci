# Avow-CI Is No More...

I recently left my job. Several weeks later I received what could essentially be
considered a Cease and Desist letter from my previous employer's legal team.

During my last week on the job I worked on Avow. I did not do so on company time
(as proven by the git commit logs), I worked on it in the evenings after I had
completed my work for the day.

They also contend that I copied code from a CI system I was working on them.

To clarify, I have not stolen code, in fact the CI system I was engaged in developing
for for the my former employer utilized a completely different approach and tech stack including
SailsJS, Durandal, and CouchDB, whereas Avow utilizes DozerJS, a custom front-end
stack, and MongoDB.

Avow also approaches the build process, task handling, reporting and other functionality
in a completely different manner. The only similarities are in my style of coding.

Regardless, I just started a new job, have a family to support and do not have
the personal resources to incur legal fees over an open source project.

Additionally I don't have the time to invest in dealing with egregious claims and
accusations as I start a new job and am focused on new successes.

As of April 18, 2014 I will be completely removing this git repository and it's
history to comply with appendTo's request.

I can only hope that in the spirit of innovation and open source, my former employer makes
the decision to reinstate the repository (under their terms if they would like) so that
those of you who found this tool useful can continue to utilize it without
facing legal action.
